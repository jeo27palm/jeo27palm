## Hey there 😄

- My name is Jovanni and I am a senior in Aerospace Engineering.
-  🖥️ I am currently working on familiarizing myself with github, git, and LaTeX. 🖥️
-  ✈️ Aerodynamics was something I was always interested in and something I have wanted to learn about and 
  through courses such as AERE310, AERE311, and AERE344 I was able to learn about the topic. I am still 
  interested in learning more about the topic. 
- 🚲 A hobby of mine is to go on bike rides. 🚲











## 📝 Required next steps 

- [x] Create a new branch. Call this branch "devel-netid" where netid is your ISU netid. For example, in my case this would be "devel-mnelson". 
- [x] Create a new markdown file in this repository. Call it "lessons_learned.md". In that file tell us what you learned and what you are still confused about! Experiment with different styles!
- [x] Create your profile README. Add a link to your profile page in the "lesson.md" you created. Let the world know a little bit more about you! What are you interested in learning? What are you working on? What's your favorite hobby? Learn more about creating your profile README in the document, ["Managing Your Profile README"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
- [X] Go to your user dashboard and create a new repository. Experiment with the features within that repository to familiarize yourself with them. Add a link to the repository you created in the "lessons_learned.md" file you created.
- [X] In this Readme.md file, after you complete each part, put an "X" in between the brackets like this [X]. This will "checkoff" each item and tells us you are done. You will do this for all future assignments.
- [X] Open a pull request on this repository and let your professor know that you’ve finished this course.
