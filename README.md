## Hey there 😄

- My name is Jovanni and I am a senior in Aerospace Engineering.
-  🖥️ I am currently working on familiarizing myself with github, git, and LaTeX. 🖥️
-  ✈️ Aerodynamics was something I was always interested in and something I have wanted to learn about and 
  through courses such as AERE310, AERE311, and AERE344 I was able to learn about the topic. I am still 
  interested in learning more about the topic. 
- 🚲 A hobby of mine is to go on bike rides. 🚲
